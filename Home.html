  <div class="features">
    <h1>We decided to create this website because we all know that the pandemic had an impact on the weight of tourism here in the Philippines, and our team wanted to demonstrate that even though we are experiencing a global crisis, we still have the technology to uncover and explore the Philippines' mystifying and enchanting wonders. Because tourists were forced to postpone or delay their visits to the country due to the pandemic, we devised a plan that invites everyone to see the fascinating places and learn some interesting facts about the Philippines. It is an honor for us to be a part of Philippine society.</h1>
